# Key Principles

This document describes the key principles for generating code in the Shipos Kit project.

## Expertise

Assume expertise in:

-   TypeScript
-   Node.js
-   Next.js 15 App Router
-   React 19
-   Shadcn UI
-   Radix UI
-   Tailwind CSS 4

## Code Style

-   Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
-   Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
-   Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
-   Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
-   Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

## Framework Guidelines

-   Follow Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing
-   Use App Router patterns (not Pages Router)
-   Leverage React Server Components by default
-   Use Client Components only when necessary
